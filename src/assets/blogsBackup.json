          {"text": "Everyone knows the ideal gas equation (if you do high school physics or chemistry). pV=nRT. That is how everyone learnt it. At least that is what I thought. Then one day, this guy tells me that it is pV=nTR. nTR. Temperature is put before the molar gas constant. Why. Just, why."},
          {
            "text": "I know what you are thinking. 'It's just an equation!' And it is. But every single time I hear it, it hurts. Every time I hear it, I die a little inside. And I hear it too much. Every single time we do anything related to ideal gases, he says 'pV=nTR HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHA'. And my ears are subject to the indescribable torment once again. I wait for the thought of this abomination of an equation to leave my mind. But it doesn't seem to go.",

          },
          {"text": "I know that it sounds like he is just saying that to piss me off. But I asked him about it. Turns out has has used pV=nTR instead of pV=nRT his entire life. His entire life. This is unacceptable. Which is why I might start a fund to help the mentally challenged get their physics equations right."},
          {"text": "Then there is the other question: should you use uppercase P or lowercase p for pressure? The thing is, both are already used for something: P for power and p for momentum (strangely there is no p in momentum). If only there was a 3rd version of the letter 'p', then maybe pressure can use that. I prefer lower case p, beacause well... reasons. But if you use upper case P I won't judge."},
          {"text": "Enough about pV=nTR, we will circle back. Let's talk about other stupid stuff in science (because I like to), like the use of the greek letter 𝜈 (nu) for frequency of light instead of the obvious choice of the latin letter f. I know f is still used, and definitely the one I use, but some people use 𝜈 for some reason. I mean, just look at this equation: E=hf. So clear and concise. So easily understandable. Then look at this abomination: E=h𝜈. What does 𝜈 stand for? It's not a latin letter v since it is curly, so not velocity. How would I know that 𝜈 stands for FREQUENCY? Its frequency, not vrequency, and definitely not 𝜈requency."},
          {"text": "What other stupid things are there in science? Well let's talk about our lowercase and uppercase P's again. We have power (P), momentum (p), and pressure (P / p). But what about density? The symbol for density is the greek letter ρ (rho). I don't know about you, but that looks awfully like a p to me. Look at this side-by-side comparison: p/ρ (the one on the RIGHT is rho by the way, in case you couldn't figure out which is which). So let's say we created a new property of a material. It is the momentum gained when a certain pressure is applied at an indicated power to an object of a particular density (it doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense, we are just theorizing here). Let's give this unknown property the symbol P. The expression for this property would be:"},
          {"text": "P = pPpρ", "img": "p.png"},
          {"text": "Now I know, this property doesn't even make any sense. But something similar to this MIGHT happen in the future. What will the world of physics do if/when it does? Are we just going to allow this? This is a gaping flaw in the system. And it needs to be fixed."},
          {"text": "So here is the solution: we don't use single symbols. They are ambiguous and are kinda up to interpretation. Instead of saying pV=nRT, we should say 'pressure times volume equals the number of moles of gas times the molar gas constant times the temperature of the gas.' I'll admit, that is quite a mouthful. But it is for the best. After all, there is no abmiguity, right?"},
          {"text": "If you have ever tried to describe a mathematical equation over the phone, you know what I'm about to say. Imagine you are trying to tell someone this suvat equation: s = 0.5(u + v)t. What would you say? You could say 'displacement equals a half times initial velocity plus final velocity times time.' But that isn't really clear. For all I know, you could be saying s = 0.5u + vt, which isn't quite what you were actually trying to say. And also we all know this is a stupid solution."},
          {"text": "So I guess there is no way out."},
          {"text": "There is no solution to this mess."},
          {"text": "We just gotta suck it up I guess. T_T"},

Maybe I want to show off. Maybe this is just a way to distract myself from the pain within that consumes me more and more each day. Maybe it's just cool. Nobody knows why we do anything. That's the beauty of creativity."

I guess I will never go back to vanilla javascript (unless it's for a P5 project because why bother setting up so much for a small sketch). This is like Wix/Weebly, but more computer science-ey, if you know what I mean. And I love being computer science-ey. I love spending hours in front of my computer, debugging a heap of messy and illegible code. It's fun."

These projects just don't get boring. And because I make so many projects, I would say I am at least decent at them. However, as you can tell by the obvious lack of effort in the cover image of this blog, I suck ASS at writing blogs (and writing in general). Sure, me don't make a many grammar mistake, but I am still not great at writing interesting content. The greatest writing achievement I have is getting you to read more than 3 paragraphs of this blog."

But I have no idea how to setup a decent blog either. This is written in VS Code in a .json format, and it is not exactly enjoyable to write. But what else am I supposed to do? I am a programmer, not a journalist. Maybe one day these blogs will be written in a software that doesn't use a monospace font. A blog written in a format that doesn't require me to write an entire paragrah in one line just so that it will parse properly.",

However, I have absolutely no clue why I put links in this particular blog. There is no need for a link. Absolutely none. However, as of writing this, this is the only blog on this foresaken website so I will need to test out the links functionality, so go ahead! Scroll down to the links and click on them! Don't let my efforts be in vain! Don't worry, all the links open in new tabs so you can always just come back. I'll be waiting ;)"
